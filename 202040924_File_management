1. File Management
Filesystem is a technic or a mechanism that allows us to store, manage and organize the data on the permanent storage device
(Harddisk) of the computer. They allow us to store the data permanently on the storage device of the computer in terms of Files and Folders

What is a File?
Internals:
File is an data structure in which operating system stores the address locations of the data where it has been stored on the harddisk
of the computer. In addition to this the operating system captures few more attributes of information pertaining to the data as well
like
1. Filename
2. created date
3. modified date
4. owner
etc

Inorder to access the data that we haved stored on the harddisk of the computer, we need to ask the operating system to fetch the
data from the address locations where it is stored, since the address locations of the data is stored within the File we can always 
ask the operating system to refer these addresses stored in the File in fetching and returning the data.
Even though the data is not directly stored within the File, rather file contains address locations where the data is stored, 
by the way we interact with operating system in asking him to store or fetch the data from the file makes us thing actually the 
data is stored within the File itself.
	
So from logical definition:
File is an data structure or physical memory location within the harddisk of the computer in which the data is being stored and accessed.
	
How to create an file on the filesystem of the computer?
Each linux user has their own home directory location for which he has permissions in creating/accessing the files/folders.
So we need to navigate to the user home directory inorder to create a file.
cd = takes you to the user home directory

touch filename
touch is the command used for creating an empty file with no data inside it under the current working directory in which we are in.
	
1. How to change to the user home directory?
cd = change directory

2. How to see in which directory we are in?
pwd = print working directory

3. how to see the files and folders in a directory?
ls = list files and folders under the current working directory

4. How to print an message on to the terminal window or console?
echo "message"
echo is an bash command used for printing or writing an message onto the terminal

for eg.. echo "good morning" > prints good morning message onto the terminal.
	
	
5. How to create an File with data being stored inside it?
every linux command when we execute will produce some output, the output that is generated by the program/command will be written directly onto the console (STDOUT). similarly a program/command takes the input data from the keyboard which is referred to as STDIN.
	
Incase if we want to change the destination to which the program has to write the output other than STDOUT or change the source from which it takes the input other than STDIN then we need to use redirection operations in linux bash which are > and < 
	
	> = redirection operator for redirecting the output
	< = redirection operator for redirecting the input
	
echo "good morning"	 = writes the "good morning" message directly onto the STDOUT, incase if we wish to redirect the output instead of to STDOUT to an File we can use > operator here

echo "good morning" > greetings.txt

now greetings.txt is a file, that is created with data inside it.
	
6. how to see the contents or the data stored inside the file?
cat filename
cat command is used for displaying the contents of a file

cat greetings.txt
1. goto home directory
cd
takes to the home directory of the user

2. create todolist directory
mkdir todolist
goto todolist
cd todolist

3. create #3 sub-directories inside todolist (082024, 092024, 102024)
mkdir 082024
mkdir 092024	
mkdir 102024	
	(or)
mkdir 082024 092024 102024
	
4. goto 082024 directory
cd 082024
touch librarysubscription.txt
touch collegeadmissions.txt
touch tripToHomeTown.txt

5. goto parent directory (todolist)
cd ..
6. goto 092024
cd 092024
	
7. create #3 files
touch chesscompetition.txt
touch officetravel.txt
touch movies-wishlist.txt

8. goto parent (todolist)
cd ..

9. goto 102024
then create #2 sub-directories
mkdir financial personal
cd financial
touch new-sb-accounts.txt
touch newpolicy.txt
touch pay-creditcard-balances.txt

10. goto parent (102024)
cd ..
11. goto personal
cd personal

12. create files
touch vacation-plan.txt
All about "cd" change directory
inorder to switch between the directory of the Filesystem we need to use cd bash command.
	
1. cd directoryName
change to the specified directory.
Note: always by using cd we can change to the directory within the Path in which we are in

   d1
|   |   |
d2  d3  d4
|
dc1
if we are in directory d1, by using cd we can change into one of the child directories of the d1 which are (d2, d3, d4) only.
if we are in d2 directory, we cannot directly jump to d3 directory, we need to navigate to one-level up means parent so that we can goto any of the childs of the parent.
	
2. we can change to the root of the Filesystem by using
cd /
"/" = always represents root if it is used alone. Linux Filesystem is hierarchial and starts with only one root indicated by "/"
	
In addition we can use "/" as an separator between the directories as below.
   d1	
   |
	 d2
	 |
	 d3
we are in d1, and wants to navigate to d3. unless we go into d2, we cannot goto d3. For this one way we can switch to d2 is
~/d1:/> cd d2
~/d1/d2:/> cd d3
we need to run #2 times the cd bash command to switch to d3

instead of this we can switch to d3 directly at oneshot by specifiying the path to the directory d3 by using "/" as an separator as below
~/d1:/> cd d2/d3 = this means first goto d2 and then after goto d3 we are specifiying at one shot by giving the complete path of navitation through "/"
	
3. How to navigate to the parent directory of the current?
cd ..
	
4. how to navigate to the home directory location of the user?
cd
cd ~ (tidle, character below the esc key on the keyboard)
~ = always represents the HOME directory of the user irrespective of where you are using
cd $HOME
$HOME = is an pre-defined variable always points to the home directory of the current user. 
there is no difference between ~ and $HOME, both are same, its just an convinience of typing the command

5. how to navigate back to the directory from where we came?
cd - 
takes back to the previous working directory from where we navigated from
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All about "ls"
ls bash command is used for listing files and folders of a given directory. by default if no directory has been passed as an input, it shows/lists files and folders of the current working directory. There are many forms of "ls", let us explore

1. how to see all the files and folders in the current working directory?
ls

2. how to see the files and folders of a specific directory other than the current working directory?
~/todolist/102024/finance:/> 
now we want to see the files and folders in 082024 directory from here

~/todolist/102024/finance:/> ls ../../082024
	(or)
~/todolist/102024/finance:/> ls ~/todolist/082024
	
ls directoryPath

3. how to see the files/folders along with sub-directories of the specified directory recursively?
	
~/>todolist
   |-082024
		 (files)
	 |-092024
		 (files)
	 |-102024
		 |-personal
		 	(files)
		 |-finance
		 	(files)
	
~/todolist:/>	ls 
ls = only shows the files/folders of the current working directory. it doesnt shows the child directories and their sub-directory contents recursively
but if we wish to see the contents of the current working directory along with child directories recursively we can use

ls -R directoryName
-R stands for recursively

4. How to list files/folders using ls with no color?
ls = by default it lists all the files and folders using color coding. If it is a directory it displays it in blue color and its an plain file, it displays in white color. If it is an executable file, then it displays in green color

we dont want any color-coding, rather display everything in white color
ls --color=none

5. how to see the long-listing of files and folders using ls?
ls -l
displays long list of files and folders with lot of information in tabular format 
FileType Permissions SymLinks owner group size(kb) last modified date  filename/directory 

FileType: is the first character in the list that indicates what type it is
d = directory
- = regular file

File permissions, owner, group and symlinks = in the follow-on sessions

6. how to see the output of ls in human readable format?
ls -lh
h = human readable format, that means the sizes are displayed in kb, mb, gb based on its size
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to know the Type of a File?
A file can be
1. text file
2. audio
3. video
4. image
5. pdf
etc
by looking at a file, how do we determine what type of file it is?
	
In general when we are creating the files, we use file extensions to quantity or specify what type of file it is by using 3 characters
Windows operating system heavily relies on the .3 character extensions to identify the file type and associate applications is using that file.
	
For eg..
if the FileType is
1. .jpeg/.png/.gif = windows operating system opens the File in Image Viewer application
2. .mkv = opens in video player application
3. .txt = opens in notepad or textpad

so from the above identifying the filetypes is very important for an operating system to associate a default program in using that file.
	
But when it comes to Linux operating system, it doesnt uses the file extensions to determine what type of file it is. So it means we dont have to create files in linux operating system with extensions.
	
Then how does linux operating system identifies, type of the file?
Linux will determine what type of File it is by looking into the contents of the file automatically.
	
But when it comes to user, if the files are created without extension, we cannot know by looking at filename what type of file it is?
To help us in identifying the type of the file, linux operating system bash interpreter has provided file command

file filename
displays the type of the file.
1. How to see the details of a File?
The details of the File means 
	- author
	- last modified date
	- size
	- permissions
	- memory address location on the harddisk
	
stat filename
stat = stands for statistics gives us statistical information about the file.
	
	
2. How to remove an existing file?
rm filename

rm stands for remove and is used for removing/deleting a file from the Filesystem. 
Note:- once we remove the file using rm, it is an permanent delete, and cannot be restored

3. How to remove multiple files?
For eg..
$HOME
|-favorites
|-wishlist
|-stories

rm favorites
rm wishlist
rm stories

all the linux commands takes multiple arguments as inputs, rather than type 3 times the same rm command we can pass #3 filenames as input at one shot
rm favorites wishlist stories

4. How to forcibily remove a file on the Filesystem?
There are few files that are considered as special files by the linux operating system, so while removing them using rm linux prompts for confirmation (y/n)	to delete the file.
Incase if we wish to delete the file without prompting for confirmation, we can use -f option as below

rm -f filename

5. How to delete a directory?
There are 2 ways we can delete a folder or a directory

#1 approach:
rmdir directoryName

rmdir deletes/removes a directory only when the given directory is empty. if the directory is not empty, we should manually go into the directory and remove all the files and sub-directories inside it before deleting the directory

for eg..
$HOME
|-library
  |-comics
		|-file.txt
	|-adventure
		|-action
			|-file2.txt
		|-war
			|-file3.txt
If we want to delete the directory library, first we need to delete file3.txt, war, file2.txt, action , adventure, file.txt, commics and then finally library
starts with lowest in the hierarchy to the top, this is safe approach of deleting the directory, because we always know what we are deleting

But it is an lengthy process and if we have lot of sub-directories with files, we need to navigate all the way down in the tree and delete and takes more time

Instead we can use approach #2

#2 approach:
rm -r directoryName

here -r stands for recursively delete all the files/folders under the specified directory along with the given directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
command = no revoke, no rollback

Moving Files and Folders
-------------------------
1. How to move a file from source directory location to an destination directory location
$HOME
|-tourplans
	|-Aug
		|-Shimla.txt
		|-Chandighar.txt
		|-NewDelhi.txt
	|-Sep
		|-Ooty.txt
		|-goa.txt
	|-Oct
		|-Kerala.txt
		


~/tourplans:/> mv Aug/NewDelhi.txt Sep/
mv stands for move, used for moving a file from one directory to other directory
1. How to move a file from one directory location to a different directory location?
	
mv sourceFile destinationDir	

2. How to move a directory along with its contents from source to the destination location?
mv sourceDir destinationDir

$HOME
|-tourplans
	|-aug
		|-trip1.txt
	|-sep
		|-trip2.txt
	|-oct
		|-trip3.txt
|-archives

move tourplans/aug/ directory to archives/ directory
~/> mv tourplans/aug archives/
	
3. How to move the contents of a directory into another directory?
$HOME
|-tourplans
	|-aug
		|-trip1.txt
	|-sep
		|-action
			|-trip2.txt
		|-adventure
			|-trip3.txt
	|-oct
		|-trip3.txt
|-archives
	
here we dont want to move sep/ directory rather just move the contents of the sep/ directory into archives
mv "tourplans/sep/*" archives
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. How to rename a file or directory?
In bash, there is no command for renaming a file or directory. But we can logically rename a file or directory by using mv itself

$HOME
|-products
	|-footwear.txt
	|-kitchen-appliances.txt
	|-furniture.txt
	
we want to rename kitchen-appliances.txt to appliances.txt
~/products:/> mv kitchen-appliances.txt appliances.txt
if we dont specify the destination directory and gave another filename, it works as rename

To rename a directory in the mv specify the destination directory as non-existing, so that it consider it as a rename.
mv products globalProducts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All about copy files/folders

cp stands for copy used for copying files/folders from one location to the another location or just to duplicate the files or folders by creating one more copy. By using cp the source/destination files will not be moved (it is not cut/copy). rather it would only copy the existing file into new directory

1. How to copy a file from one location to another location?
$HOME
|-products
	|-popular
		|-mens-fashion.txt
		|-clothing.txt
		|-jewellery.txt
	|-trending
	
let us copy clothing.txt from popular/ directory into trending/ directory using cp command
~/products:/> cp popular/clothing.txt trending/
	
during the time of copy we can specify a different name with which the file should be copied into the destination directory as below

~/products:/>cp popular/mens-fashion.txt trending/mens-apparels.txt
now the mens-fashion.txt file will be copied into trending/ directory with name mens-apparels.txt

2. How to copy a directory along with its contents into another directory?
cp only copy the file from one location to another location. cp by default doesnt works for directories. If we want to copy the directory and its contents into a different location we need to use -R switch (recursively)	
	
$HOME
|-products
	|-popular
		|-mens-fashion.txt
		|-clothing.txt
		|-jewellery.txt
	|-trending

warehouse/
	
we want to copy popular/ directory into warehouse/
~/products:/> cp -R popular/ warehouse/
	
if we want to just copy the contents of the popular directory into warehouse
~/products:/> cp -R popular/* warehouse/
